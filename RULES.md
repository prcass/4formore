## Game Play

### Round Structure

Each round consists of three phases:

#### 1. Challenge Selection Phase
- The **first guesser** (rotates each round) chooses a challenge card
- 4 challenge cards are displayed (one per category)
- Unselected cards persist to next round with "Round 2", "Round 3" badges
- Selected category is replaced with new card next round

**Token Availability**: Each card shows how many tokens are available:
- Tokens from category pool (not yet used)
- Tokens in draft pool (persistent from previous rounds)
- Center token (if category was played before)

**Strategic Consideration**: Categories with persistent tokens show:
```
🔄 Has persistent tokens
Center: [Token Name]
X in draft pool (Y total available)
```

#### 2. Guessing Phase
On your turn, you can **play bonus cards** as actions BEFORE choosing your main turn action:

**Playing Bonus Cards** (Optional, before main action):
- Use any playable cards from your hand
- Can play multiple bonus cards before your main action
- Follow each card's effect
- Cards are discarded after use (unless passive/end-game)

**Then choose ONE main turn action:**

**A. Cash In Tokens**
- Trade 2-4 tokens from your hand with matching tags for points
- 2 matching tags = 2 pts, 3 matching = 5 pts, 4 matching = 10 pts
- Use multiplier cards BEFORE cashing in (2x or 3x points)
- After cashing in, you MUST take a bonus card from the pool
- Choose one of the 3 visible bonus cards
- Pool refills to 3 cards from the deck
- Your turn ends immediately (you cannot guess this turn)

**B. Make a Guess**
1. Select a token from the 12-token draft pool (only names and tags visible, NO values)
2. Choose: **📉 LOWER** or **📈 HIGHER** than center token
3. If **CORRECT**:
   - Earn 1 point (+1 bonus with 🧠 Genius card)
   - Collect center token to your "This Round" pile
   - Your selected token becomes new center token
   - Continue your turn (repeat from bonus card step)
5. If **WRONG**:
   - You are locked out for the rest of the round
   - Your turn ends

**C. Pass**
- End your participation in this round
- Become eligible to be first guesser next round (if first to pass)
- Cannot make any more actions this round

#### 3. Round End
The round ends when all players are locked out (wrong guess) or have passed.

**Last Standing Bonus**: The last player to make an action earns +1 point.

## Token Management

### Token Lifecycle

**Draft Pool (12 tokens)**:
- Visible to all players
- Players select from here to make guesses
- Tokens removed when used as guesses

**Center Token (1 token)**:
- Current comparison token
- Shows name, statistic value, and tags
- Replaced when correct guess is made

**"This Round" Pile**:
- Tokens you collected during the current round
- Move to "Hand" at round end if you hold them
- Lost if you cash them in for points

**Hand**:
- Tokens you're holding across rounds
- Can cash in for points (see Scoring)
- Count as "tokens owned" at game end

### Tag Matching System

Each token has 2-4 tags (e.g., A1, B3, C2, D4):
- **Letter (A-D)**: Category/family (shown by hue color)
- **Number (1-5)**: Rarity/strength (shown by lightness)

Tags are used for:
- Set matching when cashing in (match any common tag across tokens)
- Bonus card effects (e.g., 🎴 Tag Trader swap requirements)

### Category Persistence

**Key Feature**: Each category maintains its own persistent state:
- **Draft Pool**: Unused tokens remain when category is replayed
- **Center Token**: Stays the same when category returns
- **Top-Up System**: When replaying a category, new tokens are drawn to bring the total (draft pool + center) back to 13

**Example**: Play Movies R1 → Countries R2 → Movies R3
- **Movies R1**: Start with 13 tokens (1 center + 12 draft), end with 5 tokens left (1 center + 4 draft)
- **Countries R2**: Play different category
- **Movies R3**: Keep the 5 remaining tokens (1 center + 4 draft), draw 8 new tokens to reach 13 total

## Strategy Tips

### General Strategy
1. **Balance Guessing & Collecting**: Don't just guess - collect tokens for big cash-ins
2. **Watch Token Counts**: Choose categories with favorable token availability
3. **Time Your Cash-Ins**: Save multiplier cards for big 3-4 token sets
4. **Bonus Card Timing**: Don't hoard cards - use them strategically

### Advanced Tactics
- **Tag Awareness**: Pay attention to which tags you're collecting
- **Category Tracking**: Remember which categories have persistent tokens
- **Challenge Card Age**: Older cards (Round 2+) may have better token pools
- **Opponent Disruption**: Use Saboteur to return opponent's key tokens
- **Risk Management**: Insurance card lets you take riskier guesses

### When to Pass
- You have a good set ready to cash in next round
- You want first pick next round
- The remaining draft pool tokens look unfavorable
- You've already earned good points this round

## Special Rules

### First Guesser Assignment
- **Round 1**: Random or chosen by group
- **Round 2+**: First player who passed in the previous round
- **If no one passed**: Same player who was first guesser in previous round
- First guesser selects the challenge card for the round

### Locked Out Players
- Cannot make any actions for rest of round
- Can still win end-game bonus cards
- Unlocked at start of next round

### Empty Draft Pool
If draft pool runs out of tokens:
- Round continues with remaining players
- No new tokens added mid-round
- Players may pass or use bonus cards only

### Bonus Card Deck Empty
If bonus card deck empties:
- Pool is not refilled when cards are taken
- Game continues with remaining cards in pool
- Does not affect gameplay otherwise

### Tie Breaker
If players are tied at game end:
1. Most correct guesses wins
2. If still tied: Most tokens cashed in
3. If still tied: Highest guess accuracy
4. If still tied: Shared victory!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I see any token values during the game?**
A: Only the center token shows its statistic value. All draft pool tokens and tokens in your hand only show names and tags - NO values are visible until they become the center token.

**Q: What happens to tokens in my "This Round" pile at round end?**
A: They move to your hand. You can cash them in later or keep for end-game points.

**Q: Can I cash in tokens during the round?**
A: Yes, cashing in is one of your main turn actions. After cashing in, you MUST take a bonus card, then your turn ends.

**Q: Do multiplier cards stack?**
A: No. Only one multiplier can be used per cash-in.

**Q: Can I play multiple bonus cards in one turn?**
A: Yes, but you can still only make ONE guess per turn.

**Q: What if a category runs out of tokens?**
A: The game prevents this - you cannot select a challenge card if fewer than 13 tokens are available.

**Q: Does the first guesser have an advantage?**
A: They choose the category, but don't necessarily go first. Turn order is separate from first guesser assignment.

**Q: Can I pass and then take an action later that round?**
A: No. Passing ends your participation for the entire round.

**Q: What happens to persistent tokens if a category isn't played for several rounds?**
A: They remain in the draft pool! If Movies is played R1, then not again until R5, those same 12+ tokens will still be there.
