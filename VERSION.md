# 4forMore Multiplayer - Version History

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Version Number Update Protocol
**ALWAYS update version numbers in ALL 5 locations when making changes:**
1. **VERSION.md** - Update "Current Development" section to next version
2. **multiplayer.html** `<title>` tag (line 6) - Browser title
3. **multiplayer.html** Mode Selection `<h1>` (line 762) - Main menu heading
4. **multiplayer.html** Online Setup `<h1>` (line 816) - Online mode heading
5. **multiplayer.html** Game Screen `<h1>` (line 1002) - In-game heading

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Search and replace all instances of version number:
#    - <title>: "4forMore V5.0.X - Description"
#    - <h1>: "4forMore V5.0.X" (appears 3 times)
# 2. Update VERSION.md: Add new version section, bump "Current Development"
# 3. Commit and tag:
git add multiplayer.html VERSION.md
git commit -m "vX.X.X: Description"
git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Version X.X.X"
```

**Quick find/replace tip:**
```bash
# Find all version occurrences in multiplayer.html:
grep -n "V5\.0\." multiplayer.html
```

## Versioning Strategy
- **Major (X.0.0)**: New game-changing features (e.g., bonus card system)
- **Minor (5.X.0)**: New features, significant changes
- **Patch (5.0.X)**: Bug fixes, small improvements, UI tweaks

## Rollback Instructions
```bash
# List all versions
git tag -l "v5.*"

## v5.1.19 - Challenge Card Persistence (2025-10-11)
**Tag**: `v5.1.19`
**Status**: Stable

### Feature Fix:
‚úÖ **Challenge Cards Now Persist Between Rounds**
- Unselected challenge cards remain available in subsequent rounds

- Only the selected category's card is replaced each round
- Console shows: `üîÑ Replacing challenge card for category: movies`

### Technical Details:
- Removed `gameState.drawnChallengeCards = []` from `endRound()` (lines 5161, 5178)
- Cards now persist and `startNewRound()` handles selective replacement
- Strategy: Older cards may have better token availability

### Example Flow:
- **Round 1**: Movies, Countries, Companies, Sports all fresh

---

## v5.1.17 - Per-Category Draft Pool Persistence (2025-10-11)
**Tag**: `v5.1.17`
**Status**: Stable

### Major Feature:
‚úÖ **Draft Pools Now Persist Per-Category Across Entire Game**
- Each category (movies, countries, companies, sports) has its own persistent draft pool
- Tokens remain available when category is replayed, even after multiple other rounds
- Example: Movies in R1 ‚Üí Countries in R2 ‚Üí Sports in R3 ‚Üí Movies in R4 shows same tokens from R1
- Challenge card selection modal shows center token name and draft pool count for categories with persistent tokens

### Technical Implementation:
- Added `categoryCenterTokens` object with per-category center tokens (line 1214)
- Added `categoryDraftPools` object with per-category draft pools (line 1220)
- Updated `confirmCategorySelection()` to check category-specific pools (line 3697)
- Updated `selectChallengeCard()` to use per-category persistence (line 3552)
- Updated `getAvailableTokensForCategory()` to track category-specific tokens (line 3689)

## v5.1.16 - Token Counter: Draft Pool Persistence (2025-10-11)
**Tag**: `v5.1.16`
**Status**: Stable

### Bug Fixes:
‚úÖ **Token Counter Now Tracks Draft Pool Persistence**
- Challenge card selection now correctly shows tokens available from:
  - Category pool (tokens not yet drawn)
  - Draft pool (tokens persisting from last time category was played)
- Simplified logic: `poolSize + draftPoolSize` instead of tracking all player hands
- Draft pool tokens remain when category is replayed, topped up to 12-13

### Technical Details:
- Complete rewrite of `getAvailableTokensForCategory()` (line 3624)
- Removed complex player hand/thisRound tracking
- Now focuses on pool management: `categoryPools[category].length + draftPool.filter()`
- Console logs `üìä Category X: Y in pool + Z in draft = W available`
- Matches game mechanics: draft pool persists across rounds for same category

---

## v5.1.15 - Fixed Token Availability Counter (2025-10-11)
**Tag**: `v5.1.15`
**Status**: Stable

### Bug Fixes:
‚úÖ **Token Availability Counter Now Works**
- Challenge card selection screen now shows accurate token counts
- Tokens drawn from pool now have `.category` property assigned
- `getAvailableTokensForCategory()` can now properly count tokens in use
- Previously always showed "40 available" because category wasn't set

### Technical Details:
- Modified `drawTokens()` function (line 3725)
- Added `token.category = category` when drawing from pool
- Tokens in player hands/thisRound arrays now trackable by category
- Console logs `üìä Category X: Y total - Z in use = W available` now accurate

## v5.1.14 - Saboteur Card & Guess Button UI (2025-10-11)
**Tag**: `v5.1.14`
**Status**: Stable

### New Features:
‚úÖ **Redesigned Recycle Card ‚Üí Saboteur**
- Renamed: `‚ôªÔ∏è Recycle` ‚Üí `‚ôªÔ∏è Saboteur`
- New effect: "Return 1 token from any opponent's hand to draft pool"
- Old effect was useless (returning your own tokens)
- Two-step selection: Choose opponent ‚Üí Choose their token to return
- Uses new `showPlayerSelectionModal()` for opponent selection
- Implementation: `executeReturnOpponentToken()` (lines 2933-3003)

### UI Improvements:
‚úÖ **Guess Button Layout Redesign**
- Buttons positioned at vertical center of challenge card (not below)
- Token name displays above each button (1.3em, bold)
- Larger buttons: 18px/28px padding, 1.2em font size
- Auto-hide after selection for cleaner UI
- Left: LOWER (red) | Right: HIGHER (green)

### User Request:
- "Let's redesign [Recycle] but make it so that you can return any token from any of your opponent's hands to the draft pool"
- "The buttons should go up in the Challenge card window... make the buttons bigger... name of token above button... disappear once choice is made"

---

## v5.1.13 - Trade Card Category Restriction (2025-10-08)
**Tag**: `v5.1.13`
**Status**: Stable

### Bug Fixes:
‚úÖ **Trade Card Now Restricted to Same Category**
- Trade card can only swap tokens within same category
- Movies swap with movies, countries with countries, etc.
- After selecting your token, pool filtered to show only matching category
- Shows helpful message: "Trading away [Token] (category). Select category token from pool"
- Prevents cross-category swaps

### User Request:
"Swap a token from your hand with one in the draft pool can only be played on tokens that are in the same category"

### Implementation:
- Modified `executeSwapTokens()` (lines 2743-2758)
- Added category filter: `sameCategory = draftPool.filter(t => t.category === playerToken.category)`
- Shows warning if no same-category tokens available in pool
- Uses `findIndex()` to map filtered selection back to full draft pool

---

## v5.1.12 - Fixed Wildcard Slot Mechanic (2025-10-08)
**Tag**: `v5.1.12`
**Status**: Stable

### Bug Fixes:
‚úÖ **Wildcard Now Works as Extra Slot, Not Tag Matching**
- Wildcard adds ONE extra slot to any existing set, not tag matching
- Shows "üåà Add Wildcard Slot" button in each set (if < 4 tokens)
- Clicking opens modal to select ANY unused token
- Selected wildcard token appears in gold with üåà emoji
- Can turn 2-set into 3-set, or 3-set into 4-set

### User Clarification:
"The wildcard should be shown as an additional token on any set you already have but then the player should be asked to choose which of their unused tokens (not in the set being cashed in) they want to use as the wildcard token"

### Example:
**Tokens:** A, B (both Action), C (Comedy)
- **Action set shows:** A, B, üåà Add Wildcard Slot
- **Click wildcard button** ‚Üí Modal shows C
- **Select C** ‚Üí Now have A, B, Cüåà (3 tokens = 5 points)

### Implementation:
- Modified `openCashOutModal()` (lines 4262-4392)
- Removed tag expansion logic from v5.1.11
- Added "üåà Add Wildcard Slot" button to each set
- Button opens `showTokenSelectionModal()` with non-matching tokens
- Selected token replaces button with gold-highlighted token button
- Wildcard tokens auto-selected and marked with üåà

---

## v5.1.11 - Fixed Wildcard Joker Mechanic (2025-10-08)
**Tag**: `v5.1.11`
**Status**: Stable

### Bug Fixes:
‚úÖ **Wildcard Now Works Like a Joker**
- Fixed wildcard to allow ONE mismatched token, not all tokens
- Tag sets now expand to show "Tag üåà" with wildcard candidates
- Wildcard candidates highlighted in gold with üåà emoji
- Matching tokens shown normally (purple)
- Tags displayed on wildcard candidates: `Token Name üåà [Tags]`

### User Request:
"But the wildcard should only allow ONE token to be different than it's tags...not all tokens"

### Example:
- Token A: `[Action, Thriller]`
- Token B: `[Action, Drama]`
- Token C: `[Comedy, Romance]`

**Without wildcard:** Can only cash in A+B (both have Action)
**With wildcard:** Can cash in A+B+C - wildcard makes C count as "Action"

### Implementation:
- Modified `openCashOutModal()` (lines 4270-4293)
- Expands tag groups to include non-matching tokens as `isWildcardCandidate`
- Gold highlighting for wildcard tokens (lines 4330-4369)
- Tag sections labeled "Tag üåà" when wildcard active
- Validation in `executeCashOut()` already handles wildcard logic correctly
